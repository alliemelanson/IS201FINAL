        <p>Marching band is a huge deal in Texas. From middle school to high school, I learned how to play the french horn and the mellophone. <br>
           In high school, I was a drum major for 2 years, and head drum major my senior year. </p>
        <p>Our marching band was nationally renown, taking 1st in our class at nationals and 6th place overall. We were consistent state finalists and medalists. </p>
        <p>While I haven't played my instrument in 6 years and marching band is very much over for me, I am forever grateful for the connections I made, the leadership skills I gained, and the opportunities marching band gave me to grow. That community was invaluable to me during highschool, and continues to be a great support to me. </p>
        <p>The following video is of our last performance my senior year, and my favorite one out of all the four years! </p>
